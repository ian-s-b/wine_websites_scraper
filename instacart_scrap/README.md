# Instacart Scrap
This folder contains the instacart scrap script based on the https://www.instacart.com/ website.

Down below you will find a quick description of each file :

- **instacart.py:**
This file contains the script that can be used to scrap data from the  instacart website. This script takes a keyword as a parameter defined on the "search_word" variable that can filter the products on the website. 

The actual script was made for the "safeway store" and the "champagne" keyword was used for the "search_word" parameter but they can be easily modified to another store and another keyword.

- **instacart.csv:** 
This file is an output of the instacart.py script.
