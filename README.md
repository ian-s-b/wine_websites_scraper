# wine_websites_scraper
The objective of this projects is to scrap data from two different websites with different structures and to create dataframes containing information about the products of these sites.

The main libraries used on this project are BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

The BeautifulSoup library can be used to scrap simple HTML and XML based websites. 

Furthermore,when we have dynamic websites, when the HTML and XML structure of the website changes according to a script (based on javascript for example), we can use a headless browser to automate some tasks (press buttons, fill forms, scroll pages, etc.) and retrieve the desired data. Thats why we use Selenium in this project.

The scraped websites are the following:

-  <a href="https://www.watsonswine.com/">Watson's wine:</a>Watson's Wine is a wine retailer in Hong Kong and a member of the A.S. Watson Group (ASW), a wholly owned subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings Limited (CK Hutchison).

- Instacart (https://www.instacart.com/):



The BeautifulSoup project can be found on the "scraping_with_bs4" folder and it was 
based on the https://www.watsonswine.com/ website.

The selenium project can be found on the "scraping_with_selenium" folder and it was
based on the https://www.instacart.com/ website.
